# cookie-consent

The most annoying cookie consent form. This was a fun project used to practice html, css and javascript.
The cooking consent form does not allow you to decline. Everytime you hover decline, the decline and accept switch places.
Once you enter the data, the website sells your data! 

Here is a gif showing the fun little project.
